I teach kids to code part time. We focus on basic concepts like `if statements`, `for loops`, and `libraries`. 
My favorite languages are 
1. English
2. Python
3. Java

In the future, my ideal careers are:
- Software Engineer
- Product Manager
- Data Scientist

I love this music group called Tomorrow X Together, and they just released an album, [minisode3: Tomorrow](https://open.spotify.com/album/0mDwrOXZHN1lgCNeBvkBbj?si=2qzwIZpwR1uYKhsoBntPkw)
