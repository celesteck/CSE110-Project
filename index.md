## **Introduction**
My name is Celeste Keyes and I am a current junior at UC San Diego pursuing a Bachelor's in Math-Computer Science with a minor in Cognitive Science. I currently work two part time jobs. I teach kids to code part time. We focus on basic concepts like `if statements`, `for loops`, and `libraries`. I also am a Peer Educator at the Academic Interity Office as well as an RA in Seventh College. Over the summer of 2023, I was an intern at Safran Federal Systems, with the title of Navigation Engineer. I learned how important math is in computer science as most of my work had focus on statistics.
My favorite languages are 
1. Python
2. C
3. Java

In the future, my ideal careers are:
- Software Engineer
- Product Manager
- Data Scientist

## **Me**
I love this music group called Tomorrow X Together, and they just released an album, [minisode3: Tomorrow](https://open.spotify.com/album/0mDwrOXZHN1lgCNeBvkBbj?si=2qzwIZpwR1uYKhsoBntPkw)

I also enjoy learning about myself and others. For example, I love exploring personality types and taking fun quizzes. Although I am very aware of the consequences of typing yourself, I think there is still a lot to learn from things like these! 
I am an INFJ. ![infj](https://c4.staticflickr.com/4/3871/18216353004_fefb8f960d.jpg) 

I am looking forward to working with a team this quarter in CSE110!
